telegram bot using google gemini mongodb and telegram
Okay, I need to document the structure of the Telegram bot project based on the provided files and folder structure. Let me start by looking at the directory screenshot. The project is named TELEGRAMTASKONION. The main files are app.py, bot.py, database.py, gemini_utils.py, utils.py, and web_search.py. There's also a .env file, a venv folder for the virtual environment, and a pycache folder which is auto-generated.
First, I should outline the purpose of each file. The app.py is probably the entry point that starts the bot. Bot.py likely contains the handlers for commands and messages. Database.py handles interactions with MongoDB. Gemini_utils.py deals with the Gemini API for generating responses and analyzing images. Web_search.py is for the web search functionality. Utils.py might have helper functions like logging setup. The .env file holds environment variables like API keys and MongoDB URI.
Next, I need to describe the project structure. The main directory has all these files. The venv folder is for dependencies, so users need to set up a virtual environment. The pycache is where Python stores compiled bytecode, which can be ignored in version control.
For each file, I should detail their responsibilities. For example, app.py initializes the bot application using the token from the environment. Bot.py has the command handlers like /start, contact handling, text messages, documents, and photos. It also checks user registration and phone number. Database.py manages user data, chat history, and file metadata in MongoDB. Gemini_utils.py uses the Gemini API for text responses and image/PDF analysis. Web_search.py handles the /websearch command by searching Google and summarizing results with Gemini. Utils.py sets up logging.
I should also mention the .env file's importance for environment variables like TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, MONGODB_URI, and GEMINI_API_KEY. Users need to create this file with their own credentials.
Then, I need to explain how to run the project. Steps would include installing dependencies, setting up the virtual environment, creating the .env file, and running app.py. Maybe include commands like pip install -r requirements.txt, python app.py.
For the project structure documentation, I should list the files and their purposes, maybe in a table or bullet points. Also, mention the virtual environment and .env configuration. Include a brief overview of each module's functionality.
Wait, the user mentioned "document it" after showing the folder structure. So the goal is to create a documentation that explains the project structure, each file's role, setup instructions, and how the components interact.
I should structure the documentation with sections like Project Overview, Directory Structure, File Descriptions, Environment Setup, Running the Bot, and maybe a section on how the components work together.
Also, note that the gemini_utils.py has functions for generating responses and analyzing images. The web_search.py does the web search and uses Gemini to summarize results. The database stores user info, chats, and files.
Make sure to mention dependencies like python-dotenv, pymongo, python-telegram-bot, Pillow, requests, BeautifulSoup, etc. Users need to install these via pip.
In the File Descriptions section, each file's purpose and key functions should be listed. For example, app.py's main function starts the bot, bot.py handles all the message handlers, database.py interacts with MongoDB, etc.
Also, the .env file is crucial for environment variables. Without it, the bot won't start because it can't find the token or API keys.
I think that's a solid outline. Now, structure this into a proper documentation with clear sections and explanations.
Here's a structured documentation for the Telegram Bot project:
Telegram Bot Project Documentation
Project Overview
This project implements a Telegram bot with Gemini AI integration, featuring user registration, chat functionality, image/file analysis, and web search capabilities. The bot stores user data and interactions in a MongoDB database.
